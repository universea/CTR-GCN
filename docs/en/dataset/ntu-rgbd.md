## Introduction

NTU-RGB+D contains 60 action classes and 56,880 video samples for skeleton-based action recognition. Please refer to its official website[NTU-RGB+D](https://rose1.ntu.edu.sg/dataset/actionRecognition/) for more details.

The dataset contains two splits when dividing the training set and test set. For Cross-subject, the dataset is divided according to character id, with 40320 samples in training set and 16560 samples in test set. For Cross-view, the dataset is divided according to camera division. The samples collected by cameras 2 and 3 are training sets, including 37930 samples, and the samples collected by camera 1 are test sets, including 18960 samples.

## Download

We provide the download link of the processed dataset [NTU-RGB-D.tar](https://videotag.bj.bcebos.com/Data/NTU-RGB-D.tar)(~3.1G). Please download and unzip with ```tar -zxvf NTU-RGB-D.tar ``` , the directory structure is as follows：
