YouTube-8M is a large-scale labeled video dataset that consists of millions of YouTube video IDs,   
with high-quality machine-generated annotations from a diverse vocabulary of 3,800+ visual entities.  
we use YouTube-8M 2018 , which is Youtube-8M’s update version in May 14th, 2018,   
with improved quality machine-generated labels, and reduced size / higher-quality video dataset.  
We transform TFRecord to pickle format for PaddleVideo.
